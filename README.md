# Multitasking-using-salvo-RTOS-for-8051-
   I have created two tasks such as TaskA and TaskB. TaskA is going to control Port1-ON and TaskB is going to control Port1-OFF.After that TaskA is again triggered by kernel and so on. TaskA and TaskB has been controlled by Round robin scheduling via kernel.
